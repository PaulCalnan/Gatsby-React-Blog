Hello all and welcome to my first post.

This URL used to be home to my coding resume but since I'm currently and happily employed in the coding industry, I've decided to re-route my URL to this blog.

Here I will jot down my thoughts on my career change into the coding industry, those parts might be useful to someone trying to transition careers like myself.

I'll also pick out some coding parts that I'm currently learning as well.
Explaining how code works is the real purpose of this blog and helps a great deal in my own understanding :)

Paul.
